# Project #2: Stardew Valley

## Overview

This project uses a Priority Queue to create a game with a priority
based task management system. The priority based management system 
uses a heap to hold the data.

## Compiling and Using

The user should run:
java MyLifeInStardew <max-priority-level> <time-to-increment-priority> 
<total simulation-time in days> <task-generation-probability> [<seed>]

This will a priority based game similar to "Stardew Valley". The game gives
the user energy while the user hopes to not pass out or die due to
energy depletion. 

## Results 

Writing the MaxHeapTest to make sure the MaxHeap class works properly was
challenging. After figuring out how the Junit testing works I was able to
properly write and use the tests for my MaxHeap class.
